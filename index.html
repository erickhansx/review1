      <p>
        Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media
        personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the
        United States from 2017 to 2021. Born and raised in Queens, New York
        City, Trump graduated from the Wharton School of the University of
        Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in 1968. He became president of
        his father Fred Trump's real estate business in 1971 and renamed it The
        Trump Organization. Trump expanded the company's operations to building
        and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He later
        started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. From 2004
        to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The
        Apprentice. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than
        4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies.
